# Project Zulu Software Application Project
	Repository for the Project Zulu software application. This repository is created as the EECS3311 course project at York University.

Team Name: Zulu

Team Members: Avaninder Bath | Nikolaos Diamantakis | John Wiens-Soshycki | Luana Ribeiro Madeira

## Note 
All implemented parts of the application work separetly but may not work together.  For example
the LineGraph and database can generate a graph for a given location. UI can load but has no real functionality
(can save user input and variables).  Database can load and take queries. 



## How To Start The Application
- Make sure Java and MySQL are installed
- Run the main Java file (in the current phase of development, the UserInterface.java file does this)
- Path for JFreeChart, mysqlconnector and Apache Commons Math Library must exist in the java project settings.json file (settings.json/pom.xml/imported).
- Enjoy!
