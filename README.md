## Version 2.0 Notes
- JFreeChart, mysql-connector, and Apache Math Commons libraries are already imported and ready to use, so there should be no need to import them manually
- All implemented parts of the application now work together, as part of the requirements for this application

## How To Start The Application
- Install Java SE 19 and MySQL Community Server 8.0.32
- During the installation of MySQL Server, set up your Workbench to have the username "root" and the password "root" for access to the database
- Create a schema called "database" in MySQL Workbench, and open/run the NHPI-Database.sql file to complete setup of the database for this program
- Run UserInterface.java - this is the main file of the program
- Enjoy!
